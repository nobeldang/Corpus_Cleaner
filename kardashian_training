Who: Kris and Bruce Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Robert Kardashian Jr, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner.

What: Happily remarried in 1991, Kris Jenner's life sounded like the plot of Cheaper by the Dozen. She had four children and so did Bruce Jenner, who had shot to fame as an Olympic athlete. The couple welcomed together two more baby girls, Kendall and Kylie.

During the Noughties, the second oldest Kardashian sister, Kim, began appearing in gossip magazines; after making friends with Paris Hilton, and dating singer Ray J. In 2007, the Kardashian-Jenners scored their own reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which is still airing to this day. Bruce's children from his previous marriage, Brody, Brandon and Burt were not featured in most of the seasons.

Let's break down the members of the family individually, shall we?
Kris Jenner

AKA: Kris the Momager

Known for: Being the mastermind behind the Kardashian family's success and a #ProudMama.

Everyone, meet the woman that made this all possible, Kris Jenner. Now you know that she married and divorced Robert Kardashian, and then remarried Bruce Jenner, with whom she had Kendall and Kylie. But what next?

During her marriage to Bruce Jenner, Kris managed the careers of all her children, ALL six of them. But her relationship with Bruce ended in December 2014, when the couple were officially divorced.

Kris then dated Corey Gamble for two years. Corey, who appeared on the family's show, was very close to the Kardashians, especially Kourtney and her kids. Fans of the show were saddened by the news of their breakup last year but they have since been seen back together.

Bruce, now, Caitlyn

Known for: Being an Olympian for the United States, his transgender story and his new life under the spotlight as Cait.

Unless you live under a rock, you will have heard of Bruce Jenner's sex transition into Caitlyn Jenner. The Olympic star came out after the couple's divorce, and rewrote her own story at the age of 65. Caitlyn fronted the cover of Vanity Fair in an epic photo shoot to publicly present her new image to the world and explain the reasons behind her decision to transition. The interview caused major drama in the Kardashian clan, as it painted Kris Jenner as unsupportive.

E! made a series called 'I Am Cait' on Caitlyn, while on 'Keeping up with The Kardashians', the sisters spoke up about how the transition affected their family.

Caitlyn's relationship with the Kardashians has changed. The family feud took centre stage, as Caitlyn released a memoir that Kris Jenner argues portrayed her in a negative light.

Caitlyn is now rumoured to be dating 23-year-old transgender model, Sophia Hutchins.

Kim Kardashian (now Kim Kardashian West) is the middle sister, and probably the best known. Growing up, Kim Kardashian hung out with Paris Hilton (and Nicole Richie, of course), and consequently, her name made the tabloids. At just 19, in 2000, Kim got married to music producer Damon Thomas, they divorced three years later. Not long after, Kim started dating the American singer Ray J and the couple infamously made a sex tape that was leaked on the internet.

Kim's love life and marriage

After her divorce in 2000, Kim stayed single before finding love with NBA player Kris Humphries. In 2011, the couple got married in California and the ceremony was aired on national television as part of a spin-off of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

Only 72 days after their nuptials, Kim filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. The media called it a publicity stunt, but when the sisters were interviewed by David Letterman, Kourtney Kardashian set the record straight: "'I think if she was going to do it for publicity, she’d pick someone that people knew." Snap, Khloe.

Not long after Kim and Kris' divorce, the reality-star was spotted hanging out with Kanye West. The duo had been friends for several years and kept their new romance under wraps in the early stages. They are now married and expecting their fourth child via a surrogate.

The Kardashian-Wests

The Kardashian-Wests

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West seemed meant to be, not only for their love of the limelight, but also because a romance blossomed from a friendship. Fans of the rapper already knew he only had eyes for Kim, rapping on his 2012 album: "And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim; Around the same time she had fell in love with him; Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang; Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team" - Jay Z owns the Brooklyn Nets, FYI - the basketball team for which Kris Humphries played at the time.

Kim and Kanye started dating the spring of that year. One year later and the couple were expecting their first baby, North West. North was born in 2013 before her parents got engaged, but of course a proposal was already in the works. In October 2013, Kanye proposed to Kim Kardashian, closing the San Francisco's AT&T park, surrounded by their family and friends - while the Jumbotron showed the words: "Please marry me".

In 2014, the Kardashian-Wests tied the knot in a very exclusive ceremony in Florence, Italy; after celebrating their engagement in Paris, and months after they made the cover of American Vogue. In February 2016, after two years happily married, the power couple welcomed their second child, baby Saint West.

This year the Kardashian-West welcomed their third child - via surrogate, since Kim was told by doctors that she would put her life at risk if she got pregnant again. The baby girl was born on January 15 and it's called Chicago West. They are now expecting their fourth child via a surrogate.

Khloé's love life

Khloé's love life

Khloé's love life has been nothing short of rocky. Khloé married the basketball Lamar Odom in 2009, after the pair dated for just three months. The couple got their own reality show and even a wedding special on E!, but the couple got divorced in 2016 after Lamar's battle with substance abuse.

After being traded several times between teams, Lamar found himself without any new opportunities, and in 2013 he didn't sign an NBA contract. That same year, Lamar was arrested for a DUI and checked into rehab, after his family urged him to get treatment. His time at the rehab was short-lived after just one day in the facilities, and a couple of months later he and Khloé started seeing a marriage councillor. In the end of 2013, Khloé filed for divorce, a source told E! News: "It wasn't any easy decision, but at the end of the day she's not going to stay with someone who refuses to get help."

Khloé then started dating French Montana, while Lamar was signed by the New York Knicks. In 2015, the couple filed documents to finalise their divorce, but three months later, Lamar was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel, having suffered a drug overdose. Khloé then called off the divorce when the basketball player woke up from a one-month coma. The Kardashian family was very present throughout his recovery. Khloé and Lamar officially finalised their divorce in 2016. "They're relieved it's over and ready to move on with their lives" a source told E! News.

Khloé is currently dating Canadian basketball player, Tristan Thompson and the couple had their first child together baby True Thompson. Congrats, Khlo!

Robert Kardashian Jr.

AKA: Rob and Bob

Known for: His sock empire, being MIA for most part of the series, and most recently getting together with his sister's ex-boyfriend's baby mama (Yep, you've read that right).

Robert Kardashian Jr. is the youngest member of the Kardashian clan and has famously stayed out of the limelight - in comparison to his sisters. In fact, he was MIA for most of the family's show seasons, due to his struggles with anxiety and depression. The star gained weight while beating his demons, but has been on a path to a healthier lifestyle since. Aside from being featured in 'Keeping up with The Kardashians', Rob was a finalist in 2011's 'Dancing With The Stars', and was a judge in the 2012 Miss USA pageant. He also runs his own socks company, Arthur George - the label's name is a combination of his middle name, Arthur, and his father's, George. Rob recently returned to telly next to his ex-fiancé, Blac Chyna, who is also his sister's ex-boyfriend's baby mama (do keep up).

Rob's love life

Rob's love life

If this sounds complicated, it's because it is. The situation couldn't get any more reality series worthy. Let us explain: Blac Chyna is Tyga's ex-girlfriend, Blac and Tyga have a son together, King Cairo. Tyga split from Kylie Jenner in 2016, Rob's youngest sister with whom she had been in an on-off relationship for two years.

Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna started dating in January 2016, and became Instagram-official with a post captioned 'The beginning'. In April that year, they got engaged, and in May they welcomed a baby girl together, Dream Renée Kardashian. Although there's been plenty of drama in between their engagement and pregnancy, the biggest fall-out of the couple came after their daughter's birth. Blac Chyna's Instagram account was hacked and messages about Rob and his family, sent by the video-vixen, were made public. In the texts Chyna called Rob "lazy," "fat" and "insecure", and mentioned trademarking her newfound Kardashian last name after matrimony. Rob recently posted naked pictures of Blac on Instagram in a revenge porn scandal.

After the couples' social media spat, Rob took to Snapchat to show that Chyna had left his house with their baby. It was later confirmed that they were living in separate homes. The couple engaged in an on-off relationship and officially broke up in February, calling off their engagement. Chyna was then spotted without her ring. But the couple are still co-parenting their daughter, Dream.

Kendall Jenner

AKA: Kenny, Ken, and Kenya

Known for: Her top modelling career, her model-esque figure, her model off-duty style (did you get the hint that she is a model, yet?), and her skills in front of and behind the camera.

Kendall has taken her career in quite a different direction from her older and younger sisters, encouraged to pursue modelling by her mum. Kendall has now fronted the runways and campaigns of major haute couture labels, like Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Prada and Fendi. The model tops the list of new faces taking the fashion scene by storm, along with her best friends Gigi and Bella Hadid.

Kendall's modelling career has kept her away from the Keeping up with The Kardashians' cameras, as she is constantly travelling for work. Kendall keeps her social life more private than her sisters, but loves using her Instagram to share one of her other passions - being behind the camera.

Romantically, Kendall is in a relationship with basketball player Ben Simmons.

Known for: Her beauty empire, her lips, almost dethroning Kim as the queen of social media and her daring outfits.

Kylie Jenner may be the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenners but at 19 years old, the star has already built a beauty empire based on her signature look (plump pouts are now a big thing because of her). Her USP, the lip kit, which consists of a lip pencil and lip paint, consistently sells out in *seconds*. The same goes for everything she launches. Don't believe us? Ask Forbes. Kylie is the youngest celeb to make the Forbes 100, having earned $41 million in the last year.

Millions of dollars aside Kylie is a typical teen on social media, and shares all her teenage dramz with fans - we're talking boys. Kylie has been in an on-off relationship with rapper Tyga, for the past two years. The couple recently split up for good and she has been dating Travis Scott.

E! News has almost broke the internet when they've announced they had inside sources telling them Kylie and Travis were expecting their first baby - not long after the Kardashians confirmed Kim's and Khloé's baby news. There must be something in the water in Calabasas...

Kylie and Travis welcomed their first child, a baby girl named Stormi on February 1, 2018. Not long after Kylie released a makeup collection inspired by her first born's name.

Last month, Forbes announced Kylie had overtaken Mark Zuckerberg as the world's youngest self-made billionaire .
